#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

---

I am an energy system modeller at the [Research Center for Energy Networks and Energy Storage (FENES)](https://fenes.oth-regensburg.de/) at the [University of Applied Sciences Regensburg (OTH Regensburg)](https://www.oth-regensburg.de/).

I studied Computer Science at the [University of Applied Sciences Regensburg (OTH Regensburg)](https://www.oth-regensburg.de/) and received my Bachelor's degree in 2021 and my Master's degree in 2023. 

My work focuses on the decarbonization of energy systems through sector coupling and green hydrogen production. I mainly do this via renewable electricity system modelling using the open source energy system model [PyPSA-Earth](https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth).
Also i am co-developing on open-source software:
- [PyPSA-Earth](https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth) is a flexible python-based open optimisation model to study energy system futures around the World
- [PyPSA-Earth-Sec](https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth-sec) is the sector-coupling extension of PyPSA-Earth
