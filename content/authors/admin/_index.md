I am an energy system modeller at the [Research Center for Energy Networks and Energy Storage (FENES)](https://fenes.oth-regensburg.de/) at the [University of Applied Sciences Regensburg (OTH Regensburg)](https://www.oth-regensburg.de/).

I studied Computer Science at the [University of Applied Sciences Regensburg (OTH Regensburg)](https://www.oth-regensburg.de/) and received my Bachelor's degree in 2021 and my Master's degree in 2023. 

My work focuses on the decarbonization of energy systems through sector coupling and green hydrogen production. I mainly do this via renewable electricity system modelling using the open source energy system model [PyPSA-Earth](https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth).
Also i am co-developing on open-source software:
- [PyPSA-Earth](https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth) is a flexible python-based open optimisation model to study energy system futures around the World
- [PyPSA-Earth-Sec](https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth-sec) is the sector-coupling extension of PyPSA-Earth
