summary: Oxford climate research network seminar - Talk about the potential role of hydrogen in a 100% renewable energy scenario
abstract: 'The global energy transition is in full swing, but is a 100% renewable energy system truly feasible and cost-effective? This talk explores the latest insights from energy system modeling, shedding light on the economic viability of fully renewable scenarios. Beyond technical feasibility, we dive into the socio-economic dimensions: How can hydrogen projects contribute to local value creation, even without export orientation? Can large-scale energy infrastructures support a Just Transition that benefits local communities? To address these questions, we integrate desalination and hydrogen underground storage into the open-source model PyPSA-Earth, refining sectoral representation and assessing real-world applicability. Join us as we navigate the intersection of energy system optimization and social justiceâ€”where technology meets transformation.'
