abstract: 'In order to achieve national and international climate protection targets, diversify Germanys and Europes energy supply, and make it more secure, it is crucial to ramp up the hydrogen economy both nationally and internationally. Two factors are essential for this ramp-up: stable international partnerships and a stable legal and financial framework.
