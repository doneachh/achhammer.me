summary: Talk at a event of the Egyptian Engineering Society
abstract: 'Green hydrogen is an essential fuel for the global energy transition and has gained increasing attention in recent years. With abundant renewable energy resources, North Africa is well positioned for large-scale hydrogen production. Egypt, in particular, has emerged as a frontrunner, seeking to leverage its industrial base and close trading ties with Europe, a key future offtaker of clean hydrogen. Yet, restructuring Egypt’s energy system to meet both domestic demand and export ambitions poses major challenges – from identifying eligible land and reinforcing the electricity to deploying storage systems and building export hubs. Addressing these challenges requires robust and transparent data. In this talk, we present results from the open-source energy system modelling framework PyPSA-Earth 
applied to Egypt. We explore renewable potentials, infrastructure needs, and investment requirements, while highlighting both co-benefits and trade-offs between national development and participation in the global hydrogen economy. The findings provide guidance for engineers, policymakers, and investors seeking to align infrastructure planning with sustainable energy transition goals.'
