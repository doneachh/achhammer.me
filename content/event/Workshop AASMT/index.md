summary: PyPSA Workshop at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport in Alexandria - From Data to Decarbonization
abstract: 'The workshop From Data to Decarbonization: Energy System Modelling with PyPSA-Earth provides a hands-on introduction to the open-source modelling platform PyPSA-Earth, designed for analyzing and planning national-scale energy systems. In a four-hour interactive session, participants will learn how to build and run energy system models and apply their knowledge in a case study on Egyptâ€™s energy transition. The case study explores how carbon budgets, demand patterns, and technology choices shape pathways toward net zero. Aimed at advanced bachelor and master students as well as early-career researchers, the workshop combines methodological training with pressing questions of international hydrogen and energy system research. Organized by the Institute for Energy Networks and Energy Storage (FENES) at OTH Regensburg within the project H2Global meets Africa, the event emphasizes open, fair, and sustainable partnerships between Europe and Africa in the emerging hydrogen economy.'
